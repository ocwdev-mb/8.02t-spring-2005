description: The objective of this resource is to determine the inductance and internal
  resistance of a coil, both with and without an iron core, on the AC/DC Electronics
  Lab circuit board, and to observe electrical oscillations, measure their frequencies,
  and verify energy relationships in an LRC circuit.
