  caption: 'Magnet Levitating Above A Superconducting Ring: The image shows a permanent
    magnet levitating above a conducting non-magnetic ring with zero resistance. The
    magnet is levitated by eddy currents induced in the ring by the approaching magnet.
    These currents are always such as to repel the magnet, by Lenz Law. (Image courtesy
    of Prof. John Belcher.)'
