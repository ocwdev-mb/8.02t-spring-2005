description: The objective of this resource is to learn how to display and interpret
  signals and circuit outputs using features of DataStudio, to investigate Ohm?s Law
  and to determine the resistance of a resistor, and to measure the time constants
  associated with a discharging and charging RC (resistive-capacitive, or resistor-capacitor)
  circuit.
